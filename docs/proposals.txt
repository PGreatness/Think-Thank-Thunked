Proposal #1-
Rubix cube -  Create a new data structure to model a rubix cube or use existing data structures to create 
one.  There could be different kinds of cubes pyramidal, cube etc.  Different versions could use different 
data structures i.e. cube = 6 matrices pyramid = 4 trees so on and so forth.  Proceed to develop algorithm for solving
the various cubes.   Utilize processing to represent each cube run animation of algorithm, and implement manual 
interaction via clicking and dragging.
Inheritance Ex.     
         Rubiks????

   2x2 cube       pyramidal

 3x3cube rectagular 

Proposal #2 -
Space Invader/ Galactica esque on rails shooter
Utilizes processing along with different hit detection stuff we've done to simulate a game of galctica.
Would have an entity abstract class to represent the different entities appearing on the screen
Ex 
		Entity
 	       /  |  \
	      /   |   \
 	Player Enemies Projeciles
	/  |     / \       /      \
       P#1 P#2 Snek Alien PlayerP  EnemyP
Would utilize data structures to store levels i.e. utilize a que to determine order of enemy spawn, ArrayList to store live entities.
Each enemy could follow a simple movement pattern determined in the draw() method of processing. Could also create an endless
level by randomly enqueing enemies proportional to how many have been killed thus far thus adding an increasing difficulty.
