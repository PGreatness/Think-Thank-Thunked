Phases of Workflow:

Step 1 : make the structure for a 2x2 rubik's cube
Step 2 : Implement mechanical portion of moving the cube
Step 3 : Visually represent the cube via processing either in a blown up view or pseudo 3d view
Step 4 : add move tracking / solution finding
Step 5 : move on to different type of cube then repeat 2x2 â†’ 3x3 


Steps 1,2,3 must be completed for a functional final project.
Steps 4,5 are additional features that can be added to a working product.

Timeline:

6/1 - complete Step 1   DONE
6/4  - complete Step 2  DONE
6/5  - complete Step 3  (1/2 DONE)

6/6 - complete Step 4
6/7 - implement 3x3 cube

Delegation:

Step 1 should be worked on together in class, so we can make key development decisions as a group.
Step 2,3 can be implemented by different members.
Step 4 should be implemented together because it is a big problem to tackle and should have many minds working on it.
Step 5 can be delegated to different members, each with a different cube type.

UPDATE: 

As of 6/04 we have completed Steps 2 and 3, but need to finish Step 3. 
Step 3 tasks: 
- Buttons for user to control cube
- Organize faces as cubes, not circles

Everything in the schedule was pushed back a day.
