/////////// Zone of Reflection \\\\\\\\\\\
------------------------------------------
OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Determining the best way to store data in the Rubik's Cube encapsulation. We settled on having six separate 2D arrays, one to represent each face, but not after lots of discussion.  

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- We defined circular moves to be a series of turns/rotations that bring the cube back to the permutation it started at. ie FC,FC,FC,FC or FC,FCC. 
- The cube can be dificult at first to use and visualize because we are trying to represent a 3D image on a 2D surface

COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- We learned how Processing and Java fit in together, and how to effectively use the draw() method. One
idea that really opened our minds was that the draw function's only job is to alter the display based on values in the 2D arrays to represent faces. In order 
to change what gets displayed, you do NOT have to alter draw(), but instead alter the values inside these containers. 
- This project also solidified the concept of helper methods and using what you wrote before to your advantage. We realized that turning a face can be represented with only one method, just with a different parameter for the face to be turned. This cut down significantly on the number of methods and cases we had to examine.
- We learned how to create buttons in Processing.

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- One mid-development change we had was changing the way we implemented the turning methods. Instead of having 5 parameters, each being one face, we realized the only information we needed to turn a face was the pointer to the face itself and the direction. Thus, 5 params was reduced to 2.
- Another change is that we realized in order to implement the counter clockwise turns, we could just call the clockwise turn 3 times (taking advantage of the symmetry of a rubik's cube).
- Also, we realized we only had to hardcode turning for one face - front. All other faces we can physically rotate the cube such that the desired face is the front face, perform the turn, then rotate the cube back.

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Planning before coding. This may sound like we are simply regurgitating what has been said all term, but we really mean it. Roughly half our time was devoted to planning, organizing, drafting up UMLs and flowcharts, creating a todo list and workflow priorities.
- Adding small changes may take a lot more time than you think, so it is important to plan your time ahead. 
- Use helper functions that make your code clean.
- Thnk simple. Many complex ideas were thrown around when deciding how to implement hint functionality and move tracking, but we finally settled on a simple, yet effective idea.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5/26/18 - Devlog created still in planning stages

5/27/18 - Whipped up a super rudimentery proof of concept for the galactica idea and early cube (Ahnaf)

5/30/18 - Decided on pursuing a rubiks cube simulation project. We also decided on the data structure to use - instead of having a 3D matrix (array of 2D arrays), we decided it would be better to store data in 6 separate 2D arrays, one for each face. This makes it easy so you dont have to deal with corner and side tiles having multiple colors in the 3D array. We also drew up a way to make sure the program always knows the path to solve the rubix cube. When you shuffle at the beginning, keep track of the moves you make in a STACK. (Colin, Ahnaf, Peter)
        - Drafted plan to detail project workflow (Colin)
 

5/31/18 - Created a rubiks cube abstract class (Peter)

6/3/18 - Added limited rotational functionality for front face, mainly as a starting point. Face can rotate but doesn't compensate for the other faces yet. (Ahnaf)
       - Updated plan to reflect workflow (Colin)


6/5/18 - 
       - Improved turning functionality to change other faces as well. Have to do the same for the other faces (Peter)
       - Wrote README, revised UML Diagram and flowchart (Colin)
       - Updated plan to reflect workflow (Colin)
       
6/6/18 - All faces turning completely functional(Peter)
       - Move tracking --> solver functionality(Peter)
       - Removed mouse-clicking method and put in keyboard shortcut for turning front face clockwise (Ahnaf)
       - Added working turn functionality for front face only (Ahnaf)
       - Fixed turning to work with all other faces. Renamed left to right (Ahnaf)
       - Fixed incorrect naming of left and right (Peter)
       - Added back removed README.md and removed duplicate repo (Ahnaf)
       - Added rudimentary Button class (Ahnaf)

6/7/18 - Fixed Button class, now works as intended (Ahnaf)
       - Added ToggleButton class (Ahnaf)
       - Fixed front rotation occurring twice (Ahnaf)
       - Added PNG file to use in starting screen. Unable to do so (Ahnaf)
       - Added turning button for front face as a test (Ahnaf)
       - Removed turn button (Ahnaf)
       - Created the threeCube class based on the twoCube (Peter)
       - Added comments to help understand Button classes (Ahnaf)
       - Updated/revised devlog, README, UML Diagram, flowchart (Colin)
       - Improved move tracking by updating stack when user makes a move (Colin)
       - Added hint functionality, debugged hint functionality (Colin)
       - Added toggle between cubes and command page (Ahnaf)
       - Fixed guide and go back Buttons flashing after clicked (Ahnaf)
       - Fixed guide not working after clicking Toggle Cutout twice (Ahnaf)
       - Added large sized title to project (Ahnaf)
